# diamond-price-prediction

This is a project that I did as an final project for my internship at BCC. 

There's a two version of this project:
* `main_diamond_original.ipynb`
* `main_diamond_modified.ipynb`

The original one is the one that I made with my teammate Vania Malinda, credits goes to her, she suggesting a lot of ideas especially in *Data Preparation* and *Exploratory Data Analysis* sections. 

The modified version is the one that I built throughout my journey as Junior Data Scientist.
